            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Buyers</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">The Climbing Shoe Shop will allow a refund request for an item if the item was never shipped by the seller, if the item recieved is not as described, or if it is damaged or lost during shipping. Only in these cases may a buyer request a refund."Not as described" only includes: gouges, stains, cracks, incorrect size, and sometimes color. Buyers are not eligible for refunds if they are unsatisfied with the item, only if there is an error as described above. The buyer must request a return or refund through The Climbing Shoe Shop by opening a dispute within 72 hours of receipt of the item (determined by the tracking information submitted by the seller). Buyers must respond to requests for documentation or information from The Climbing Shoe Shop witin 3 business days. Failure to do so will result in automatic cancellation of the dispute and resolution in favor of the seller.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Any claim for a refund must be accompaanied by a complete unboxing video that begins before the package is opened and shows a complete picture of the box being opened. The unboxing video must be submitted to The Climbing Shoe Shop by the buyer within the 72 hours refund period for a dispute to be eligible for submission. The buyer is responsible for recording and creating a video of the unopened box containing the item before it is opened, and throughout the opening process. A clear, uncut, and unaltered video of the entire unboxing process from before the box is opened to after the item is unwrapped is required to make any claim for a refund. Before commencing the unboxing video, the box must still be sealed as it was when it left the seller's possession. This video acts as your protection and proof that the item was damaged before it arrived to you. Any suspicion of tampering with the package (such as opening it and reclosing it) is grounds for dismissal of proof.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">If the buyer provides incorrect shipping information, such as an inaccurate house number, zip code, apartment number, or fails to include an apartment number, and the package is subsequently lost, whether due to delivery to an incorrect address or loss during return to sender, the responsibility lies with the buyer. The Climbing Shoe Shop and the seller are not liable for issues arising from inaccurate shipment details provided by the buyer. If a package is successfully returned to the sender due to an incorrect address provided by the buyer and they choose not to have it re-shipped, the refund will be issued minus the original shipping fee, which will go to the seller to cover the initial shipment cost. If the buyer does want the item re-shipped, they will need to update and confirm their address, as well as cover the additional shipping costs for re-shipment.</p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Item Not As Described</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">An item is not as described if the buyer can demonstrate that it is significantly different from the seller's listing description or photos. It is the seller's responsibility to fully disclose the condition of any item listed for sale on The Climbing Shoe Shop. This includes, but is not limited to, any visible known flaws such as stains, cracks, gouges, repairs, or any other imperfections. Being unsatisfied with an item is not a valid reason for a refund. Please note that listing photos alone do not satisfy the requirement to disclose these details; all such information must be clearly described in the listing's written description. Failure to accurately disclose an item's condition may result in a refund dispute and other penalties per our marketplace guidelines. These are a few examples of an item not as described:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-1">
              <li>The item recieved is a different size, model, or color.</li>
              <li>The item has damaged that was not disclosed.</li>
              <li>The condition of the item is misrepresented (e.g., the item is described as new but is used).</li>
              <li>The buyer recieved the incorrect quantity of items.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">The buyers refund from a dispute for an item not as described upon delivery will not be issued until the item is returned to the seller. The buyer will only recieve their refund once the item has been shipped back to the seller and is delivered to the proper return address as indicated by the seller. If an item is recieved not as described, and a return is warrented, the return shipping cost is paid by the seller. The seller has the option to allow the buyer to keep the item and still get a refund, if the seller decides they do not whish to recieve the item back from the buyer.</p>

              Climbing shoes should fit snugly but not painfully. They&apos;ll stretch about half a size with wear. If you&apos;re between sizes, consider the type of climbing you&apos;ll do most: tighter for sport/bouldering, more comfortable for all-day trad climbing.
